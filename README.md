# Aim-Trainer
# Game Project with Pygame

ðŸŽ® This project is developed in Python using the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). Pygame is utilized to set the display mode, define the window title, and incorporate various Pygame functions for drawing shapes and text.

## Game Logic

The heart of the game lies in the main game loop, where both game logic and rendering are managed. The `Target` class plays a central role by controlling properties such as position, size, growth, and appearance.

### How to Run the Game

1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the game using the following command:

   ```bash
   python main.py
